# LEMPPress
Version 0.0.1

LEMPPress is a [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) development environemnt for WordPress powered by the [LEMPDash](https://github.com/pbredenberg/lempdash) command-line tool.

Right now, it only really works to back-link to LEMPDash. Have I mentioned LEMPDash? It is a commandline tool.

This doesn't work yet. But LEMPDash does. Usually.
